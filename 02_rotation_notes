## different kinds of file compression: .tar, .tar.gz, .zip, .gz
## for .gz
  gunzip
## do not unzip fastq.gz files, most programs can run using this format

  unzip

## created new directory under F19_diblab_rotation/ called test_reads/ to put subsetted data into for testing
## made subset.sh to create fastq.gz files for each sample that contains only 1000000 reads
## used some of this code: http://www.sixthresearcher.com/list-of-helpful-linux-commands-to-process-fastq-files-from-ngs-experiments/
  #!/bin/bash

  # this script will extract the first 1000000 reads from each .fastq.gz file in inputs/
  for file in ~/F19_diblab_rotation/inputs/HSM*
  do
          # one read with header, sequence, qc score takes up 4 lines
          # 4000000/4=1000000
          base=$(basename "$file" .fastq.gz)
          # F1mil stands for first 1 million reads
          zcat $file | head -4000000 | gzip > ~/F19_diblab_rotation/test_reads/$base.F1m.fastq.gz
  done
## random subsetting of paired end reads
## can be done in bash, see: http://www.sixthresearcher.com/list-of-helpful-linux-commands-to-process-fastq-files-from-ngs-experiments/
## other programs that may be able to do this: BBmerge (reformat.sh), seqtk, seqIO
## use reformat.sh to randomly subsample 1000000 read
## install BBMap
  curl -O https://astuteinternet.dl.sourceforge.net/project/bbmap/BBMap_38.73.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf BBMap_38.73.tar.gz
## created file subset_random.sh

## it doesn't look like bbmap kept the quality scores? looks reformated a bit?
## in the future, install things into your environment using conda (even BBMap)
## check the conda repository for conda installable packages
## install plass in the rotation environment
  conda activate F19_diblab_rotation
  conda install -c bioconda plass
## check to see what packages are installed
  conda list
## check location of a package (i.e. plass)
  which plass
## for random subsampling, use khmer: https://anaconda.org/bioconda/khmer
## use this script specifically (view on github): khmer/scripts/sample-reads-randomly.py
## created new directory within test_reads/ called random/
## install khmer in F19_diblab_rotation (~/)
  conda install -c bioconda khmer
